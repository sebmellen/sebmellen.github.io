					Hello, welcome to my magestic, wonderful site!
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Please note that this is my <em>first webite</em>, so don't go too hard on on me, <strong>please</strong>. <br/>Thank you :).

				<p>
					Have you ever wondered how to make text <mark>highlighted</mark>? Just use the "mark" tag!
				</p>

				<p>
					Now, it must be remembered that there are important things to do, namely:
					<!-- This is called an "unordered list", as designated by the "ul". It lists the items within it with bullet points only. -->
						<ul>
							<li>Take out the trash</li>
							<li>Eat dinner</li>
							<li>Feed the cat</li>
						</ul>
					Don't forget, these three duties are very important. However, I seem to have put them in the wrong order. Here's how it should really look:
					<!-- This is called an "ordered list", as designated by the "ol". It lists the items within it with bullet points in the form of numbers. -->
						<ol>
							<li>Feed the cat</li>
							<li>Take out the trash</li>
							<li>Eat dinner</li>
						</ol>
